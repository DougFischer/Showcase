After leaving Oasis in 2009, he formed and became the lead vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter for Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Oasis had various line-up changes, though Gallagher and his brother Liam remained as the staple members. Gallagher began playing guitar at the age of 12, and became a roadie and technician for Inspiral Carpets at the age of 21. He learned that Liam had formed a band called The Rain, which eventually became Oasis, and Liam invited him to join them as the lead guitarist. He agreed on condition that he would write their material. The band's debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994), was a critical and commercial success. Their second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries, and their third studio album, Be Here Now (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Britpop eventually declined in popularity and Oasis failed to revive it, though their final two albums, Don't Believe the Truth (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul (2008), were hailed as their best efforts in over a decade.
